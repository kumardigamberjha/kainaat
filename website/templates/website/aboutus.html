    <div class="text">
        <p>SpaceBaby Kai is a popular Instagram handle belonging to 1.5 year old Kainaat Mahajan. Her social media presence is handled by her mother, Tanya who is usually chronicling the adventures and excursions Kainaat is usually on, on her Instagram handle @spacebaby_kai.</p>
        <p>We have decided to dedicate this space to Kai and keep it as a record for her to see one day. It would most likely be the greatest wealth, the greatest asset to leave your baby girl-a written account of her journey in this world. </p>
        <p>Many people ask-Why “SpaceBaby”? Well, Kainaat means The Universe so what other than the Space to relate to the most? Kainaat is a peppy little animal lover who loves to spread cheer and smiles wherever she goes. </p>
        <p>While you’re here, to make it worth your while, there is a blog written and maintained by Tanya who is an avid reader and passionate for writing. You’ll find the letters she is writing for her baby girl to grow up and read. And also, giving out her first hand motherhood experiences here. </p>
        <p>There is also a shop with the official SpaceBaby merchandise. We’ve tried to keep it as concise and meaningful as possible!</p>
        <p>We’d love to hear from you! Suggestions, pieces of advise, or a word or teo of encouragement, we’ll welcome them all! 
            Feel free to write to us for promotions or collaborations too.</p>
